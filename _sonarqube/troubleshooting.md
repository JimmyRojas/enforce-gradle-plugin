# Adding rules to profile

In case you perform your analysis and see that some of the [rules](http://fundacionjala.github.io/enforce-gradle-plugin/sonarqube/rules) have been overviewed or ignored, it might be because the rules need to be added to the [Quality Profiles](http://docs.sonarqube.org/display/SONAR/Quality+Profiles), which in many cases will be the default profile. Follow these steps to activate the rule in the profile:

### 1. Log in as Administrator.

![sonar login](../../img/sonar-login.png)

### 2. Go to the Rules tab
![rules tab](../../img/rules-tab.png)

### 3. Select Apex in languages in the left panel.
![select apex language](../../img/select-apex-language.png)

### 4. Then click on Bulk Change

### 5. Click on activate in
![select Bulk Change](../../img/select-bulk-change.png)

### 6. Write Apex and click on apply
![write apex](../../img/write-the-languaje.png)
